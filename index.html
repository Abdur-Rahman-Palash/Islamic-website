        <section class="How-It-Works">
            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <p>The following 7 steps summarize how we'll get you out of the beginner phase so you can learn Arabic online no <br> different than if you were studying abroad at an established madrasah:</p>
            <h4>STEP 1: Study the CORE and Central Theme of How the Language Works </h4>
            <p>When you learn this core and central theme first, you will have a bird's eye view of the entire language. This will <br> help you learn Arabic quickly and without stress. Because now each time a new rule or pattern is introduced, it’s <br> not going to be just a random piece of information that needs to be memorized. It’s now a key piece of the big <br> picture that you eagerly grasp and put into place to make your understanding of the language clearer and clearer.</p>
            <h4>STEP 2: Begin Your First Arabic Book in the Third Week of Class</h4>
            <p>As you see the rules that you’ve learned come alive in the pages of this story book, your enthusiasm level will go <br> through the roof. Not only that, but you’ll have a perfect opportunity to learn the rest of the language organically <br> and contextually, based on need and necessity, as the author gradually brings more and more complex <br> structures. </p>
            <h4>STEP 3: Complete a 132 Page Classical Book in Grammar, Cover to Cover</h4>
            <p>Text: Hidayah an-Nahw
<br>
                In the second semester (roughly the 7th month of study), we take everything we’ve learned in grammar and <br> morphology and put it into practice as we start reading our first unvoweled text (i.e. without tashkeel, harakaat <br> or zabr, zer and pesh). This is where you'll learn to think at the level of the scholars. </p>
            <h4>STEP 4: Dive Deep into the Meanings of the Qur’an</h4>
            <p>Here we will be going through the verses of the Qur’an and learning about rhetorical devices and language <br> patterns. We will cover two large surahs from the Qur’an with a very thorough grammatical <br> and rhetorical analysis. The themes, language patterns and rhetorical devices you’ll learn about in these verses will equip you <br> to understand hundreds of other verses like them.</p>
            <h4>STEP 5: Master Classical Logic and the Modes of Argument</h4>
            <p>Studying mantiq will deepen your appreciation of the <br> Qur’an. Because entire sequences of verses within the Qur’an are formatted based on the rules of Logic. When you understand exactly why a particular argument leads <br> to its conclusion you will appreciate the argument to a much higher degree. You’ll go beyond satisfaction into <br> absolute certitude.</p>
            <h4>STEP 6: Attain True Proficiency Through Second Grammar Text</h4>
            <p>Text: Ibn Aqeel’s commentary on the Alfiyyah of Ibn Malik. 
<br>
                Because this commentary is quite easy to understand, you’ll be able to focus your efforts on getting more <br> proficient at reading quickly. Our aim is to gradually wean you off of conscious deciphering – and take you to <br> the point where the deciphering becomes subconscious. So you can read and <br> understand Arabic as quickly and easily as you do English.</p>
            <h4>STEP 7: Arabic Rhetoric (balaagha) or the Study of Eloquence </h4>
            <p>Text: Mukhtasar Al-Ma’aaniImam Taftazani’s commentary on al-Qazweeni’s Talkhees Al Miftah
<br>
                Rhetoric is the most exalted and noble area of study concerning the Arabic language. It is said that it is through <br> the principles of Rhetoric (balaagha) that “the veils are removed from the faces of miraculousness within the verses of the <br> Qur’an”.
                
                The study of balaagha will open up a whole new world for you, exposing you to the most wondrous things. We’ve <br> saved this text for the final months of Year 2 so that you’ll have something exciting to <br> look forward to.</p>
